    FIND_AND_REPLACE(cell, find, replace): Text replacement

* Data Visualization

- Chart creation functions with multiple types:

    CHART(range) or LINECHART(range): Line chart
    BARCHART(range): Bar chart
    PIECHART(range): Pie chart
    AREACHART(range): Area chart

* Spreadsheet Interface: 

- Mimic Google Sheets UI: Strived for a visual design and layout that 
closely resembles Google Sheets, including the toolbar, formula bar, and 
cell structure. 
○ Drag Functions: Implemented drag functionality for cell content, formulas, 
and selections to mirror Google Sheets' behavior. 

- Cell Dependencies: Ensured that formulas and functions accurately reflect 
cell dependencies and update accordingly when changes are made to 
related cells.  

* Testing: 

- Users can test and implement functions with their 
own data.

# 🛠️ Technology Stack

* Frontend -

    React.js
    Redux Toolkit for state management
    Tailwind CSS for styling
    JavaScript

* Libraries -

    react-window for virtualized grid rendering
    recharts: Data visualization
    Redux Toolkit: Global store
    react-icons: Web App logo
    and more

# 🏗️ Architecture

* State Management

- Redux store with slices for:

    ○ Cell data and formatting
    ○ Grid dimensions
    ○ Selection and active cell state
    ○ Error handling



* Components
- Layout

   ○ App.jsx : Main spreadsheet component with toolbar , formulbar , grid , dimenssion controls and footer component
   ○ Grid: Main spreadsheet component with virtualized rendering that renders individual cells and charts 
   ○ Cell: Individual cell component with editing capabilities
   ○ FormulaeBar: Formula input and cell reference display
   ○ toolbar : for cell and data formatting
   ○ menubar : NON FUNCTIONAL
   ○ DimensionControls: Row and column management
   ○ ChartComponent: Data visualization renderer
   ○ ResizeHandle: Row/column resize functionality

- Store
   ○ spreadSheetSlice and index where the global state and reducers are defined with dependent cell value evaluation.

- utils
   ○ Custom Formulae Evaluation engine that holds the logic for all the mathematical and graphical function as well as cell refrencing.

# 🎯 How to Use

* Basic Operations

- Cell Editing:

    ○ Double-click any cell or press F2 when cell is selected
    ○ Type value or formula
    ○ Press Enter or click outside to save


- Formula Entry:

   ○ Start with '=' symbol
   ○ Reference cells using their coordinates (e.g., A1, B2 )
   ○ Use mathematical operators (+, -, *, /)
   ○ Use functions like SUM, AVERAGE, etc. (as specified above)


- Cell Selection:

   ○ Click to select single cell
   ○ Click and drag to select range
   ○ Use shift+click for multiple selection



* Using Functions

- Mathematical Calculations:
    =SUM(A1:A5)
    =SUM(A1:A5,B2,C3)
    =AVERAGE(B1:B10)
    =MAX(C1:C20)
    and more

- Data Quality:
    =TRIM(A1)
    =UPPER(B1)
    =FIND_AND_REPLACE(A1, "old", "new")
    and more

- Creating Charts:
    =BARCHART(A1:A10)
    =PIECHART(B1:B5)
    =LINECHART(C1:C15)
    and more

- Formatting

    Select cell(s)
    Use the formatting toolbar to:

    Apply text styles (bold, italic, underline)
    Change font properties
    Adjust alignment
    Set background color



- Grid Management

    Use the dimension controls to:

    Add/remove rows and columns
    Adjust row heights and column widths
    Navigate through the spreadsheet



* ⚠️ Important Notes

- Formula Dependencies:

    Cells update automatically when referenced cells change
    Circular references are not supported


- Performance:

    Grid virtualization handles large datasets efficiently
    Complex formulas on large ranges may impact performance


- Data Persistence:

    Currently operates in-memory
    Implement your own persistence layer as needed



* 🔍 Tips and Best Practices

1 Use cell references in formulas instead of hard-coded values although you can use hardcoded values for various operations as well
2 Leverage range operations for bulk calculations
3 Use appropriate chart types for different data sets
4 Regularly check for formula errors
5 Use data quality functions to maintain clean data

* Bonus Features Implemented includes

    - Implement additional mathematical and data quality functions.
    - Added support for more complex formulas and cell referencing.
    - Incorporated data visualization capabilities.
