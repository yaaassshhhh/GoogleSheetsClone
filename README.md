* Spreadsheet Interface: 

- Mimic Google Sheets UI: Strived for a visual design and layout that 
closely resembles Google Sheets, including the toolbar, formula bar, and 
cell structure. 
‚óã Drag Functions: Implemented drag functionality for cell content, formulas, 
and selections to mirror Google Sheets' behavior. 

- Cell Dependencies: Ensured that formulas and functions accurately reflect 
cell dependencies and update accordingly when changes are made to 
related cells.  

* Testing: 

- Users can test and implement functions with their 
own data.

# üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

# üèóÔ∏è Architecture

* State Management

- Redux store with slices for:

    ‚óã Cell data and formatting
    ‚óã Grid dimensions
    ‚óã Selection and active cell state
    ‚óã Error handling



* Components
- Layout

   ‚óã App.jsx : Main spreadsheet component with toolbar , formulbar , grid , dimenssion controls and footer component
   ‚óã Grid: Main spreadsheet component with virtualized rendering that renders individual cells and charts 
   ‚óã Cell: Individual cell component with editing capabilities
   ‚óã FormulaeBar: Formula input and cell reference display
   ‚óã toolbar : for cell and data formatting
   ‚óã menubar : NON FUNCTIONAL
   ‚óã DimensionControls: Row and column management
   ‚óã ChartComponent: Data visualization renderer
   ‚óã ResizeHandle: Row/column resize functionality

- Store
   ‚óã spreadSheetSlice and index where the global state and reducers are defined with dependent cell value evaluation.

- utils
   ‚óã Custom Formulae Evaluation engine that holds the logic for all the mathematical and graphical function as well as cell refrencing.

# üéØ How to Use

* Basic Operations

- Cell Editing:

    ‚óã Double-click any cell or press F2 when cell is selected
    ‚óã Type value or formula
    ‚óã Press Enter or click outside to save


- Formula Entry:

   ‚óã Start with '=' symbol
   ‚óã Reference cells using their coordinates (e.g., A1, B2 )
   ‚óã Use mathematical operators (+, -, *, /)
   ‚óã Use functions like SUM, AVERAGE, etc. (as specified above)


- Cell Selection:

   ‚óã Click to select single cell
   ‚óã Click and drag to select range
   ‚óã Use shift+click for multiple selection



* Using Functions

- Mathematical Calculations:
    =SUM(A1:A5)
    =SUM(A1:A5,B2,C3)
    =AVERAGE(B1:B10)
    =MAX(C1:C20)
    and more

- Data Quality:
    =TRIM(A1)
    =UPPER(B1)
    =FIND_AND_REPLACE(A1, "old", "new")
    and more

- Creating Charts:
    =BARCHART(A1:A10)
    =PIECHART(B1:B5)
    =LINECHART(C1:C15)
    and more

- Formatting

    Select cell(s)
    Use the formatting toolbar to:

    Apply text styles (bold, italic, underline)
    Change font properties
    Adjust alignment
    Set background color



- Grid Management

    Use the dimension controls to:

    Add/remove rows and columns
    Adjust row heights and column widths
    Navigate through the spreadsheet



* ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Formula Dependencies:

    Cells update automatically when referenced cells change
    Circular references are not supported


- Performance:

    Grid virtualization handles large datasets efficiently
    Complex formulas on large ranges may impact performance


- Data Persistence:

    Currently operates in-memory
    Implement your own persistence layer as needed



* üîç Tips and Best Practices

1 Use cell references in formulas instead of hard-coded values although you can use hardcoded values for various operations as well
2 Leverage range operations for bulk calculations
3 Use appropriate chart types for different data sets
4 Regularly check for formula errors
5 Use data quality functions to maintain clean data

* Bonus Features Implemented includes

- Implement additional mathematical and data quality functions.
- Added support for more complex formulas and cell referencing.
- Incorporated data visualization capabilities.
