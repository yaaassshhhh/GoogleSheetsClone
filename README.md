üéØ How to Use
Basic Operations

Cell Editing:

Double-click any cell or press F2 when cell is selected
Type value or formula
Press Enter or click outside to save


Formula Entry:

Start with '=' symbol
Reference cells using their coordinates (e.g., A1, B2)
Use mathematical operators (+, -, *, /)
Use functions like SUM, AVERAGE, etc.


Cell Selection:

Click to select single cell
Click and drag to select range
Use shift+click for multiple selection



Using Functions

Mathematical Calculations:
Copy=SUM(A1:A5)
=AVERAGE(B1:B10)
=MAX(C1:C20)

Data Quality:
Copy=TRIM(A1)
=UPPER(B1)
=FIND_AND_REPLACE(A1, "old", "new")

Creating Charts:
Copy=BARCHART(A1:A10)
=PIECHART(B1:B5)
=LINECHART(C1:C15)


Formatting

Select cell(s)
Use the formatting toolbar to:

Apply text styles (bold, italic, underline)
Change font properties
Adjust alignment
Set background color



Grid Management

Use the dimension controls to:

Add/remove rows and columns
Adjust row heights and column widths
Navigate through the spreadsheet



‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

Formula Dependencies:

Cells update automatically when referenced cells change
Circular references are not supported


Performance:

Grid virtualization handles large datasets efficiently
Complex formulas on large ranges may impact performance


Data Persistence:

Currently operates in-memory
Implement your own persistence layer as needed



üîç Tips and Best Practices

Use cell references in formulas instead of hard-coded values
Leverage range operations for bulk calculations
Use appropriate chart types for different data sets
Regularly check for formula errors
Use data quality functions to maintain clean data
